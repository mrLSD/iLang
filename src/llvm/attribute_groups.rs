//! # Attribute Groups
//!
//! Attribute groups are groups of attributes that are referenced by
//! objects within the IR. They are important for keeping .ll files
//! readable, because a lot of functions will use the same set of
//! attributes. In the degenerative case of a .ll file that corresponds
//! to a single .c file, the single attribute group will capture the
//! important command line flags used to build that file.
//!
//! An attribute group is a module-level object. To use an attribute
//! group, an object references the attribute groupâ€™s ID (e.g. #37).
//! An object may refer to more than one attribute group. In that
//! situation, the attributes from the different groups are merged.
