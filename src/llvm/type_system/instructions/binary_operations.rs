//! # Binary Operations
//!
//! Binary operators are used to do most of the computation in a program.
//! They require two operands of the same type, execute an operation on
//! them, and produce a single value. The operands might represent multiple
//! data, as is the case with the vector data type. The result value has
//! the same type as its operands.
